## Virtual Random File

This is a tool to generate virtual file filled with random data that can be used for test purposes, especiall when you are limited by disk space or disk bandwidth. Data in the virutal file is generated by the time it is read, so there is no memory overhead or disk usage at all. The data is generated based on offset, so no matter how many times you accessed the file, you can always expect the same data as long as the offset is the same.

## Getting Started on Linux

1. Install FUSE3

    on CentOS/Fedora/REHL:

    ```bash
    yum install fuse3 fuse3-devel
    ```

    or on Ubuntu/Debian:
    
    ```bash
    apt-get install fuse3 libfuse3-dev
    ```

2. Build

    Navigate into source folder
    
    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    cmake --build .
    ```

3. Run

    For example, we want to create a 20TB virtual file.
    
    ```bash
    mkdir mountpoint
    ./vrfs 20TB mountpoint
    ```

## Getting Started on Windows

1. Install [WinFsp](http://www.secfs.net/winfsp/)

    When installing WinFsp make sure to choose "Developer" to ensure that all necessary header and library files are included in the installation.

2. Build

    Navigate into source folder

    ```bat
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake .. -A x64
    cmake --build . --config Release
    ```

3. Run

    For example, we want to create a 20TB virtual file and mount it onto an unsed drive F:
    
    ```bat
    vrfs 20TB F:
    ```

## Getting Started on macOS

I've never tried to run it on macOS, but it should be the same as on Linux because there's this [FUSE for macOS](https://osxfuse.github.io/) project.
